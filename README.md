# TicTacToe

This project is a Tic Tac Toe game on the Web. The goal is to play against the AI attempting to make three marks in a row. Because Tic Tac Toe is a solved game, my AI is unbeatable.

See it in action: [The Tic Tac Toe](https://the-tic-tack-toe.web.app/)

## Features 

You can choose to be either X, O or random with X's always going first. Your game state saves locally so you can return to the game anytime. Statistics are kept for the user locally and the game also keeps global statistics on a simple json server. The AI should play perfectly. I wrote it myself and I had to have a volunteer play and beat the AI for a while. 

## Tools Used

- **Framework** Angular 10
- Animations done in CSS
- AI written custom in typescript
- Web Local Storage used to save game state and local statistics
- Bootstrap, CSS and media breaks used to make it mobile and tablet friendly
- Bootstrap used as much as possible for formatting
- This is a Single Page Application (SPA)
- Firebase is used to host and automatically deploys when there is a push to master

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
